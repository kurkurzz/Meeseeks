            <p>Huh, another day is it? Just woke up from sleep, eyes still closed, asking myself what will I do today.
            Oh yeah, tons of them... why do I even need to do all those works? Oh yeah, I need money... I need to ‘survive’,
            this is my ‘role’ in this strange world that I am living in. Standing in front of the mirror, brushing my teeth,
            thinking about my life, thinking about my future, it makes me wonder, what is my purpose?
            </p>
            <p>Sooner or later, I will die. My parents will die. Everybody will die. Rotting in the grave, six feet underground, 
            alone and forgotten. What’s the point of being remembered anyway, not like it’s going to change anything. I already dead, 
            the world does not even matter to me now. Waiting and waiting for what will come. Cannot run, cannot hide. This is where I 
            will be after a hell ride of a life. But I’m curious, what happened to the world I lived in?
            </p>
            <p>Another soul being taken, another soul being born. That’s just how it works. No one lives forever in this damned world. 
            But is the world going to be different for the new souls? Or is it will be the same? Just creating another history for 
            the next generation, repeat until poof, doomsday. Doesn’t it makes you think, what’s the point of living? Is it only to 
            entertain the next generation? How about the very last generation? What’s their purpose? Oh my, why humanity even exist?
            </p>
            <p>There must be a reason. It must be. But what? Hell, did I even asked to be born? Did I? Oh God, what is it? 
            Wait… is this a test?
